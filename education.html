        <h1>Where it all began.</h1>
        <p>
          It all started for me in the local pre-school in Glounthaune. <i>The
          Early Years Centre</i> is a fine institute for early dvelopment and learning
          and set me on my path to where I am today.  I'm not going to lie, I can't
          remember anything about my time there other than the generic crap I just
          gave you so lets just move on to my time in primary school.
        </p>

        <h1>The Story Continues.</h1>
        <p>
          Moving on to the next chapter of my education, I began studying... yes
          studying... In <i>Glounthaune Primary School</i> or to give it its proper name
          <i>Scoil N&aacute;isi&uacute;nta an Chro&iacute; Naofa</i> in 2005.
          I learned many valuable skills throughout my time in primary school
          from matching and colouring to counting. Some would argue that I hit my
          peak in fifth class when I was eight time champ of our running game of
          last man standing but I would beg to differ, for me, the best is yet to come.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h1>The Story Continues... Again</h1>
        <p>
          It is safe to say that I entered secondary school in <i>Christian Brothers' College</i>
          a boy and left... Well not a man but a bigger boy or manchild if you will. I thuroughly
          enjoyed my time in <i>C.B.C</i> and made many friends that I hope to keep in contact with
          in the future. From the atmosphere on senior cup game day to the heated debates over the most
          pointless topics at lunch time, I wouldn't change a thing about my experience in second level education.
          Because this is where I did the majority of my information absorption, I will split
          this into two sections, <i>Junior Cycle</i> and <i>Leaving Cycle</i>.
        </p>
        <section>
          <h1>Junior Cycle</h1>
          <p>
            At the time, what seemed the all encompassing <i>Junior Cert</i> I have later
            discovered is completely irrelevant. I took <b>eleven subjects</b> for my <i>Junior
            Cert</i> as listed below <b>in order of preference</b>.
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Maths</li>
            <li>Science</li>

          <h1>The Dreaded Leaving Cert</h1>
          <p>
            <i>The Leaving Cert</i> is without a doubt one of the toughest obstacles I
            have had to overcome in life thus far. The pressure and stress students are
            under is incomparable to anything else I have experienced. The many hours
            studying information that on the most part would be completely irrelevant to me
            for the rest of my life was a tough grind. However, having come out the other
            side, I am immensely proud of my efforts and results in the exams which got me into
            the course I've always wanted to study, <i>CK401</i> or <i>Computer Science</i> in <i>UCC</i>
            Below is a table of the subjects I took for my <i>Leaving Cert</i> along with their levels and
            results.

        <p>
          After the hard slog through <i>The Leaving Cert</i>, I have made it to where
          I've always wanted to be, studying Computer Science in <i>U.C.C</i>. I am
          currently coming towards the end of my first semester in first year and I am
          loving both the course material and the huge change in lifestyle between second
          and third level education. Below is a table of my modules and their codes for
          semester 1.
